# Introduction

Jiiify is a IIIF toolkit for Java. It's also still very much a work in progress. As a result, some parts of this site are more fully developed and others are still in an early stage of development. The contents for this site are managed in the [jiiify-docs](https://github.com/ksclarke/jiiify-docs) GitHub repo. Suggestions, improvements, and questions, etc., are welcome through [pull requests](https://github.com/ksclarke/jiiify-docs/pulls), [issues/tickets](https://github.com/ksclarke/jiiify-docs/issues), and [discussion board](https://github.com/ksclarke/jiiify-docs/discussions) posts.

Currently, the most developed part of the Jiiify toolkit is Jiiify Presentation, a Java library for working with IIIF Presentation manifest and collection documents. There is also a early draft of a IIIF Image library, called Jiiify Image. Other components will be added in the future.
